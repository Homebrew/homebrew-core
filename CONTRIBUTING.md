# Contributing to Homebrew

First time contributing to Homebrew? Read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Homebrew/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#code-of-conduct).

### To report a bug

* run `brew update` (twice)
* run and read `brew doctor`
* read [the Troubleshooting Checklist](https://docs.brew.sh/Troubleshooting)
* open an issue on the formula's repository

### To submit a version upgrade for the `foo` formula

* check if the same upgrade has been already submitted by [searching the open pull requests for `foo`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pulls?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+foo).
* `brew bump-formula-pr --strict foo` with `--url=...` and `--sha256=...` or `--tag=...` and `--revision=...` arguments.

### To add a new formula for `foo` version `2.3.4` from `$URL`

* read [the Formula Cookbook](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook) or: `brew create $URL` and make edits
* `brew install --build-from-source foo`
* `brew audit --new-formula foo`
* `git commit` with message formatted `foo 2.3.4 (new formula)`
* [open a pull request](https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request) and fix any failing tests

### To contribute a fix to the `foo` formula

If you are already well versed in the use of `git`, then you can find the local
copy of the `homebrew-core` repository in this directory
(`$(brew --prefix)/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/`), modify the formula there
leaving the section `bottle do ... end` unchanged, and prepare a pull request
as you usually do. Before submitting your pull request, be sure to test it
with these commands:

```
brew uninstall --force foo
brew install --build-from-source foo
brew test foo
brew audit --strict foo
brew style foo
```

After testing, if you think it is needed to force the corresponding bottles to be
rebuilt and redistributed, add a line of the form `revision 1` to the formula,
or add 1 to the revision number already present.

If you are not already well versed in the use of `git`, then you may learn
about it from the introduction at
https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request and then proceed as
follows:

* run `brew edit foo` and make edits
* leave the section `bottle do ... end` unchanged
* test your changes using the commands listed above
* run `git commit` with message formatted `foo <insert new version number>` or `foo: <insert details>`
* open a pull request as described in the introduction linked to above, wait for the automated test results, and fix any failing tests

Thanks!

### Getting your pull request merged

All Homebrew maintainers are volunteers. We make use of scheduled tasks to help
us with merging pull requests, as we get hundreds a day. These are triggered by
a maintainer submitting a valid approving review ("green tick") on your PR.
Within an hour after that approval, our scheduled GitHub Action will merge your
PR.

If you push commits - for example to fix CI failures - after an approval has
been granted by a maintainer, GitHub will dismiss the reviews and we'll have to
start from scratch. Don't be discouraged, though - further improvements are
welcome!

If your PR fixes a formula security vulnerability, or is something we otherwise
would like to release quickly, maintainers can run the commands manually to
publish your changes right away.

Your PR will show up as "closed, with unmerged commits", but this is normal:
you'll still get author credit for the changes. In the GitHub UI, it will
show up as "Closed in <master-branch-commit-sha>".
