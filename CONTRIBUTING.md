# Contributing to Homebrew

First time contributing to Homebrew? Read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Homebrew/.github/blob/HEAD/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#code-of-conduct).

Ensure your commits follow the [commit style guide](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook#commit).

### To report a bug

* Run `brew update` (twice).
* Run and read `brew doctor`.
* Read [the Troubleshooting Checklist](https://docs.brew.sh/Troubleshooting).
* Open an issue on the formula's repository.

### To submit a version upgrade for the `foo` formula

* Check if the same upgrade has been already submitted by [searching the open pull requests for `foo`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pulls?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+foo).
* `brew bump-formula-pr --strict foo` with one of the following:
  * `--url=...` and `--sha256=...`.
  * `--tag=...` and `--revision=...`.
  * `--version=...`.

### To add a new formula for `foo` version `2.3.4` from `$URL`

* Read [the Formula Cookbook](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook) or: `brew create $URL` and make edits.
* `brew install --build-from-source foo`.
* `brew audit --new-formula foo`.
* `git commit` with message formatted `foo 2.3.4 (new formula)`.
* [Open a pull request](https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request) and fix any failing tests.

Once you've addressed any potential feedback and a member of the Homebrew org has approved your pull request, the [BrewTestBot](https://github.com/BrewTestBot) will automatically merge it a couple of minutes later.

### To contribute a fix to the `foo` formula

If you are already well versed in the use of `git`, then you can find the local
copy of the `homebrew-core` repository in this directory:
`$(brew --repository homebrew/core)`. Modify the formula there using `brew edit foo`
leaving the section `bottle do ... end` unchanged, and prepare a pull request
as you usually do.  Before submitting your pull request, be sure to test it
with these commands:

```
brew uninstall --force foo
brew install --build-from-source foo
brew test foo
brew audit --strict foo
brew style foo
```

After testing, if you think it is needed to force the corresponding bottles to be
rebuilt and redistributed, add a line of the form `revision 1` to the formula,
or add 1 to the revision number already present.

If you are not already well versed in the use of `git`, then you may learn
about it from the introduction at
https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request and then proceed as
follows:

* Run `brew edit foo` and make edits.
* Leave the section `bottle do ... end` unchanged.
* Lest your changes using the commands listed above.
* Run `git commit` with message formatted `foo <insert new version number>` or `foo: <insert details>`.
* Open a pull request as described in the introduction linked to above, wait for the automated test results, and fix any failing tests.

Once you've addressed any potential feedback and a member of the Homebrew org has approved your pull request, the [BrewTestBot](https://github.com/BrewTestBot) will automatically merge it a couple of minutes later.

Thanks!
